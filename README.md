#Election Audit Summary
This script can be used for any election by
1. uploading a election_results.csv with different counties and/or candidates to analyze a different part of the state or different candidates
2. changing the largest county turnout section to the smallest county turnout section to increase marketing campaigns in those counties in hopes of increasing turnout in whomevers favor
